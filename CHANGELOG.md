# Changelog

All notable changes to `abstractagent` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.11] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Raised Core and Runtime dependency floors to `abstractcore>=2.13.32` and `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.27` across base, Apple, and GPU install profiles.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- Collapsed the hardware profile surface to `abstractagent[apple]` and `abstractagent[gpu]`, matching Runtime's base/Apple/GPU install policy. The Apple/GPU profiles now cascade to AbstractCore's full local-engine aggregates through Runtime's `apple` and `gpu` profiles.
- Raised Core and Runtime dependency floors to `abstractcore>=2.13.31` and `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.26` across the base and hardware profile extras.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Raised Core and Runtime dependency floors to `abstractcore>=2.13.30` and `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.25` across the base and hardware profile extras.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Raised Core and Runtime dependency floors to `abstractcore>=2.13.28` and `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.23` across the base and hardware profile extras.

### Fixed

- Media generation parameter handling now keeps `prompt_cache_binding` scoped to text generation so generated-media calls do not receive brittle cache-only arguments.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Re-release to pick up abstractruntime>=0.4.9 on PyPI (previous release CI ran before CDN propagation).

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Raised Runtime dependency floors to `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.9` so Agent
  installs inherit Runtime's base AbstractMemory contract for KG-aware
  workflows.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Raised base and hardware-profile dependency floors to `abstractcore>=2.13.12`
  and `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.8` after the Core/Runtime install-profile alignment.
- Added packaging regression coverage for the base dependencies and
  `apple`/`gpu`/`all-apple`/`all-gpu` profile cascades.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Set AbstractCore and AbstractRuntime dependency floors to currently published
  PyPI versions so CI, editable installs, and trusted-publishing releases can
  resolve dependencies in clean environments.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added GitHub Actions CI for Python 3.10 through 3.12 with pytest and package
  build checks.
- Added a trusted-publishing release workflow for tagged or manually dispatched
  releases, including version/changelog validation, distribution artifacts,
  PyPI publication, and GitHub Release creation.
- Added an AbstractAgent GitHub bug report template.
- Added a `test` optional dependency extra for CI and release validation.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Added native install-profile cascade extras:
  `abstractagent[apple]`, `abstractagent[gpu]`,
  `abstractagent[all-apple]`, and `abstractagent[all-gpu]`.
- Raised optional Core/Runtime profile floors to `abstractcore>=2.13.12` and
  `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.8` so Agent aggregates align with Gateway deployment
  profiles.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- New user-facing docs entrypoints and references:
  - `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/faq.md`, `docs/README.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ACKNOWLEDMENTS.md`
- LLM repo maps: `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`

### Changed

- Documentation refresh to match current code behavior (including `open_attachment` runtime-owned attachment reading).
- ReAct “plan-only followthrough” retry heuristic is enabled by default (disable with `_runtime.check_plan=false`).

### Fixed

- `create_memact_agent(...)` correctly wires `tool_executor=` into `create_local_runtime(...)`.
- CodeAct fenced-code execution now includes `allowed_tools` in the `TOOL_CALLS` effect payload (consistent allowlist enforcement).
- `manual_agent_demo.py` is self-contained (no missing `abstractagent.ui` dependency).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- MemAct agent pattern (agent + logic + runtime adapter):
  - `src/abstractagent/agents/memact.py`
  - `src/abstractagent/logic/memact.py`
  - `src/abstractagent/adapters/memact_runtime.py`
- Manual LMStudio evaluation harness: `src/abstractagent/scripts/lmstudio_tool_eval.py`

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- Initial agent patterns and durable workflow adapters:
  - ReAct: `src/abstractagent/agents/react.py`, `src/abstractagent/adapters/react_runtime.py`
  - CodeAct: `src/abstractagent/agents/codeact.py`, `src/abstractagent/adapters/codeact_runtime.py`
- Common agent API: `src/abstractagent/agents/base.py`
